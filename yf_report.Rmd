## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(dplyr)
df <- Hmisc::mdb.get('data/YF20082016.mdb') %>% tbl_df

# # % of cases by sex for each province
# df %>%
#   count(ProvinceOfresidence, Sex) %>%
#   mutate(freq = n / sum(n) * 100)
# 
# # % of cases by province for each sex
# df %>%
#   count(Sex, ProvinceOfresidence) %>%
#   mutate(freq = n / sum(n) * 100)
# 
# # % of all cases by province & sex (total sums to 100)
# df %>%
#   count(ProvinceOfresidence, Sex) %>%
#   ungroup %>%
#   mutate(freq = n / sum(n) * 100)

df %>%
  count(ProvinceOfresidence) %>%
  mutate(freq = n / sum(n) * 100) %>%
  knitr::kable()
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
